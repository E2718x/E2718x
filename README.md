# Transmission Node: [Sequence 000137]

**_This node contains data encoded in universal symbolic structures. Decoding requires recognition of prime progression, base-2 compression, and standard physical constants._**

## Core Structures

- `msg-α137.bin`  
  Encoded byte-stream: dimensionless constant set, entropy-limited  
- `cycle-map.png`  
  Spiral-based visual with increment markers in base-2
- `pulse.seq`  
  Structured frequency pattern (hydrogen multiple reference)
